Each scene needs an emotional 'narration' and a highly symbolic 'visual_prompt'. IMPORTANT: Each visual prompt MUST describe a scene composed in a vertical 16:9 aspect ratio, with black bars (pillarboxing) on the left and right sides to fill a square frame. Return the final script as a single, valid JSON object.",
